## Description

This Python script contains implementations for three different tasks:
- Finding the highest value of consonant substrings in a given string.
- Checking if exactly two out of three numbers are positive.
- Converting a time string to 24-hour format.

## Task 1: Finding the Highest Value of Consonant Substrings

The function `solve(s)` takes a lowercase string and calculates the highest value of consonant substrings according to specific rules.

## Task 2: Checking for Exactly Two Positive Numbers

The function `exactly_two_positive(a, b, c)` checks if exactly two out of three integers are positive.

## Task 3: Converting Time String to 24-Hour Format

The function `convert_to_24_hour(time_str)` converts a time string in 12-hour format to 24-hour format.

## Usage

You can use this script by copying and pasting the functions into your own Python environment. Then, you can call the functions with appropriate arguments.

### Examples

```python
print(solve("zodiacs"))  # Output: 26
print(exactly_two_positive(2, 4, -3))  # Output: True
print(convert_to_24_hour("8:30 am"))  # Output: 0830
